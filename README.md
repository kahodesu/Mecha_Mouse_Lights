# Mecha_Mouse_Lights

This is an Arduino program for the Trinket for a mouse-sized mouse-piloted cardboard model of a character I made for a game that Ramsey and I are working on. The model was created so that it can help me better imagine the mecha so that I can draw it virtually better. 

The program is basically a one button interface to toggle through a couple of light patterns. I am using single Neopixels which were wired and soldered in a series. The Trinket and the button are on a mini-bread board, stuck on top of a 3-AAA battery pack, stored inside its foot. 

Photos of the model will be posted when taken.
